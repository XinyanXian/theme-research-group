 abstract = {This research compares the performance of deep learning models and large language models in a time 
series traffic flow prediction. The evaluation results reveal distinct model performance differences 
based on dataset selection and input length. Deep learning models show similar performance between 
different datasets, while large language models exhibit significant improvements when trained on post-COVID-19 data. Regarding input length, longer sequences generally enhance predictions. Large 
language models consistently reduce error metrics as input length increases, while deep learning models 
maintain a relatively stable trend. These findings highlight the superior capacity of large language 
models to process and utilise long-term dependencies in time series prediction.},
