 abstract = {This research applies spatial Durbin model to analyse traffic flow distributions via various factors in the urban areas and traffic flow data. The results show that the overall built environment within a buffer area has more significant impact on urban traffic flow compared to the nearby location within a few meters. Areas with more young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows. With the influence of COVID-19, residents prefer to spend their daily life in their local neighborhood rather than having long distance travel. The initial findings from this research provide evidence of developing 20-minute city via active travel for achieving net-zero carbon target.},
