 abstract = {Glasgow, Scotland, United Kingdom, has long-term issues with inequalities in health and food security, as well as large areas of vacant and derelict land. Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36 % of the total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.13, p = 0.0003) between the walking travel time to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49 % and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture projects could both help with the city's problem of vacant and derelict land and bring many potential benefits to local communities.},
