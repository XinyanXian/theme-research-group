 abstract = {Land use conflicts (LUCs) are pivotal in understanding the complex interactions between human activities and global changes. This paper proposes a conceptual framework to analyze LUCs, focusing on land use suitability (LUS), scarcity, and diverse development objectives. It introduces a multi-level spatial assessment framework designed to identify LUCs, promoting sustainable land use practices. We chose China as the case study due to its status as the largest developing country and its intricate land use challenges. By integrating the "ecological-agricultural-urban" function with a four-tier classification of conflict intensity, our study identifies 12 distinct conflict patterns. Additionally, we classified LUCs into nine archetypes based on competing land use attributes within each 250-meter grid cell. Our empirical results show that the current LUS in China has intensified land use rivalry and conflicts. The geographical distribution, land category composition, and the intensity and manifestation of these conflicts exhibit significant variability across different LUC zones. We identified 14 regional zones, highlighting significant spatiotemporal variations in conflict distribution. Key findings include the positive impact of converting unused land to forestland and the negative effects of transforming agricultural land into construction land. These findings underscore the need for tailored land management strategies for each city or region, based on their specific development contexts.},
