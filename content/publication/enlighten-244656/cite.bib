 abstract = {Due to the problem that current methods obtaining the weight values in intensive land use evaluation is influenced much by subjectivity of experts, cloud models to determine weight values were introduced in this study. Taking Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone as an example, cloud models was applied in intensive land use evaluation of development zone. Results showed that the comprehensive intensive land use value of Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone was 0.889, which achieved a sound balance between the supply and demand of land use. The state of land use reached a relatively high level of land use intensity as well as industrial land coverage. Based on land use efficiency, the output intensity of industrial land and high-tech land were both relatively high. In terms of management performance, there was no idle land, which suggested relatively perfect outcome of management. In the end, this paper summarized the advantages of using cloud models by presenting a more objective outcome and more easy-to-achieve algorithm. The application of Cloud Models is conducive to intensive land use evaluation in a more scientific way, so that it will benefit the policy-making processes of Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone.},
