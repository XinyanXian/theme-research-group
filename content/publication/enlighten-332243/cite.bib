 abstract = {This study uses building footprint data from the Ordnance Survey MasterMap to analyze construction and demolition activities across England from 2017 to 2023. By comparing the Topographic Object Identifiers (TOIDs) of each building between years, we identified newly constructed and demolished buildings, quantified changes, and used the bivariate color maps to visualize spatial patterns across England and within its five major cities. The study highlights the effectiveness of building footprint data in providing insights into urban changes and development trajectories, which are vital for urban planners and policymakers to understand dynamic urban processes and inform decision-making toward sustainable urban development.},
