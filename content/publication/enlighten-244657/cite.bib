 abstract = {Since cannabis (marijuana) has been listed by the U.S. federal government as a Schedule I substance under the Controlled Substances Act of 1970, legalization of cannabis has been a hot topic for decades. In this featured graphic, a total number of 296,192 self-reported cannabis records from the contiguous United States were collected by crowdsourcing. With a national average cannabis price of 284 USD/oz., states with the highest price of cannabis are where cannabis possession/selling is illegal and the sample size is small; states with the lowest price of cannabis where cannabis possession/selling is legal.},
