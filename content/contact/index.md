      title: Opportunities for Prospective PhD Students
      text: |-
        I am always interested in hearing from prospective students who are eager to pursue a PhD under my supervision. Currently, I plan to take several new PhD students in the current academic year. Before reaching out, please ensure you have explored potential funding options or scholarships if needed. For further details, please visit [here](https://www.gla.ac.uk/postgraduate/research/geospatialdatascience/).

        To facilitate our discussion, please email me the following:

        - Your CV
        - Your academic transcripts
        - A brief research proposal (2-3 pages) outlining your proposed doctoral project. The project should align with my previous or current research areas to ensure I can offer the appropriate support and mentorship throughout your studies.
