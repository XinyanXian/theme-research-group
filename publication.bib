        abstract = {Urban development is shaped by demographic and socio-economic factors, while simultaneously influencing these dynamics. Understanding these complex relationships is essential for informed urban planning, yet previous research has struggled with fine-scale analysis over large areas due to data and methodological limitations. This study overcomes these challenges by leveraging high-resolution building footprint data and eXplainable AI (XAI). Focusing on England between 2017 and 2023, we first quantify and map the extent of new urban development and further model it as a function of population density, ethnic composition, and the Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) using machine-learning algorithms. We then interpret the best-performing model with SHAP values and reveal a substantial nonlinear correlation between these demographic and socio-economic factors and new urban development. This analytical framework offers a novel, scalable, interpretable approach to fine-grained urban analysis, and, for the first time, provides a nationwide quantitative assessment of how population density, ethnic composition, and deprivation jointly shape urban development in England, thereby supporting evidence-based and equitable planning and policymaking.}

This study utilizes intercity migration and investment flow data to explore the roles of shrinking cities in China's urban network, focusing on flow patterns, network connectivity, and spatial interdependencies. The results show that migration outflows from shrinking cities are concentrated in provincial capitals, whereas investment flows predominantly target national economic centers such as Beijing and Shanghai. Shrinking cities demonstrate higher connectivity in migration networks than in investment networks, often functioning as peripheral nodes with constrained influence. Distinct spatial patterns between migration and investment flows reveal significant regional disparities, highlighting uneven economic interdependencies across China's regions. We propose a comprehensive framework integrating flow pattern analysis, network metrics, and spatial association modeling to assess shrinking cities' roles in regional population and capital redistribution. The findings offer critical insights into the network roles of shrinking cities, supporting the formulation of coordinated development strategies across China's regions.},

This paper formalizes the concept of 'urban pattern language' as a multi-scalar analytical approach to decode such complexity, drawing on Christopher Alexander's idea that offers solutions for recurrent design problems observed in historic and contemporary urban settings. This analytic approach is applied to two case study cities to explore how urban forms can be decoded and communicated across scales and demonstrate how urban morphological elements can be systematically organised into recognisable patterns that simplify analysis and enhance understanding. The findings show that these patterns are not arbitrary but follow structured, rule-based relationships that vary across scales, revealing an underlying order within the urban form. Finally, the study illustrates that these rules are unique to each city, potentially reflecting specific cultural, historical, and spatial contexts. By identifying city-specific, multi-scalar patterns, this framework offers a powerful framework for urban planning and design, allowing practitioners to develop adaptable and context-sensitive strategies.},

By simulating the changing commercial floor space in different urban centres and its impact on commuting patterns, we evaluate the master plan's impact on urban spatial structure and promoting polycentric urban development. Singapore's master plan, with a clear vision towards polycentricity through the 'Local hubs and global gateways' strategy, is examined for its impact on urban spatial structure. The study uses urban mobility data and spatial network analysis to reveal how the master plan aims to decentralise development from the Central Business District (CBD) and distribute economic activities across various regions. Our findings indicate that regional centres and local hubs are becoming more autonomous while the CBD remains dominant. The results also highlight the importance of integrating morphological and functional polycentricity measurements and socioeconomic indicators to comprehensively evaluate urban development strategies.

        abstract = {Urban areas serve as critical habitats for numerous plant species. Existing studies suggest that, due to human-mediated introductions, urban environments often harbor a greater variety of plant species compared to suburban areas, potentially becoming focal points for biodiversity. Consequently, investigating the driving forces and complex mechanisms by which urban environmental factors influence plant species distribution is essential for establishing the theoretical foundation for urban biodiversity conservation and future urban planning and management. Solar radiation, among these factors, is a critical determinant of plant growth, development, and reproduction. However, there is a notable lack of research on how this factor affects the distribution of urban plant species and influences species' richness and composition within plant communities. We present for the first time an analysis of how solar radiation drives the spatial distribution of plant species within the built-up areas of Nanchang City, China. Based on three years of monitoring and survey data from experimental sites, this study employs three evaluation models-Species Richness Index (R), Simpson's Diversity Index (D), and Shannon-Wiener Index (H)-to analyze and validate the survey results. Additionally, MATLAB and ArcGIS Pro software are utilized for the numerical simulation and visualization of spatial data. Our study shows that areas with low solar radiation exhibit higher plant species richness, while plots with high plant diversity are primarily concentrated in regions with strong solar radiation. Moreover, the Diversity Index D proves to be more sensitive than the Shannon-Wiener Index (H) in evaluating the spatial distribution of plant species, making it a more suitable metric for studying urban plant diversity in our study area. Among the 18 plant species analyzed, Mulberry and Dandelion are predominantly dispersed by birds and wind, showing no significant correlation with solar radiation. This finding indicates that the spatial distribution of urban plant species is influenced by multiple interacting factors beyond solar radiation, highlighting the critical need for long-term observation, monitoring, and analysis. This study also suggests that shaded urban areas may serve as hubs of high species richness, while regions with relatively strong solar radiation can sustain greater plant diversity. These findings underscore the practical significance of this research, offering essential insights to guide urban planning and management strategies. Additionally, this study offers valuable insights for the future predictions of plant species distribution and potential areas of high plant diversity in various urban settings by integrating computational models, building data, Digital Elevation Models (DEMs), and land cover data.},

We chose China as the case study due to its status as the largest developing country and its intricate land use challenges. By integrating the "ecological-agricultural-urban" function with a four-tier classification of conflict intensity, our study identifies 12 distinct conflict patterns. Additionally, we classified LUCs into nine archetypes based on competing land use attributes within each 250-meter grid cell. Our empirical results show that the current LUS in China has intensified land use rivalry and conflicts. The geographical distribution, land category composition, and the intensity and manifestation of these conflicts exhibit significant variability across different LUC zones. We identified 14 regional zones, highlighting significant spatiotemporal variations in conflict distribution. Key findings include the positive impact of converting unused land to forestland and the negative effects of transforming agricultural land into construction land. These findings underscore the need for tailored land management strategies for each city or region, based on their specific development contexts.},

However, existing deep learning models often face challenges related to scalability and flexibility as datasets grow. To this end, this paper introduces GeoAggregator, an efficient and lightweight algorithm based on transformer architecture designed specifically for geospatial tabular data modeling. GeoAggregators explicitly account for spatial autocorrelation and spatial heterogeneity through Gaussian-biased local attention and global positional awareness. Additionally, we introduce a new attention mechanism that uses the Cartesian product to manage the size of the model while maintaining strong expressive power. We benchmark GeoAggregator against spatial statistical models, XGBoost, and several state-of-the-art geospatial deep learning methods using both synthetic and empirical geospatial datasets. The results demonstrate that GeoAggregators achieve the best or second-best performance compared to their competitors on nearly all datasets. GeoAggregator's efficiency is underscored by its reduced model size, making it both scalable and lightweight. Moreover, ablation experiments offer insights into the effectiveness of the Gaussian bias and Cartesian attention mechanism, providing recommendations for further optimizing the GeoAggregator's performance.},

We include factors such as road characteristics, socio-demographics, surrounding built environments (land use and nearby points of interest), and the emerging urban big data source of Google Street View images to understand their influences on time series traffic flows. Taking the city of Glasgow as the case study, we have found that areas with more young and white dwellers are associated with more traffic flows, while natural green spaces are associated with fewer traffic flows. Major roads between cities and towns also show heavier traffic flows. Besides, the application of Google Street View images in this research has revealed the heterogeneous effects of green space on urban traffic flows, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by distance. We also detect that the spatial dependence between adjacent neighbourhoods among the traffic flows and associated urban parameters is variable during the four COVID-19 periods. With the influence of COVID-19, there has been a significant decrease in long-distance travel. The noticeable change in travel behaviour presents a valuable opportunity to encourage active travel in the near future.},

        abstract = {Public transportation, especially in large cities, is critical for livability. Counting passengers as they travel between stations is crucial to establishing and maintaining effective transportation systems. Various information and communication technologies, such as GPS, Bluetooth, and Wi-Fi, have been used to measure people's movements automatically. Regarding public transportation applications, the automated fare collection (AFC) system has been widely adopted as a convenient method for measuring passengers, mainly because it is relatively easy to identify card owners uniquely and, as such, the movements of their card holders. However, there are serious concerns regarding privacy infringements when deploying such technologies, to the extent that Europe's General Data Protection Regulation has forbidden straightforward deployment for measuring pedestrian dynamics unless explicit consent has been provided. As a result, privacy-preservation techniques (e.g., anonymization) must be used when deploying such systems. Against this backdrop, we investigate to what extent a recently developed anonymization technique, known as detection k-anonymity, can be adapted to count public transportation travelers while preserving privacy. In the case study, we tested our methods with data from Beijing subway trips. Results show different scenarios when detection k-anonymity can be effectively applied and when it cannot. Due to the complicated relationship between the detection k-anonymity parameters, setting the proper parameter values can be difficult, leading to inaccurate results. Furthermore, through detection k-anonymity, it is possible to count travelers between two locations with high accuracy. However, counting travelers from more than two locations leads to more inaccurate results.},

In response, this study introduces a novel semi-supervised multimodal learning method for Twitter user occupation prediction with a limited number of training samples. Specifically, an unsupervised learning model is first designed to extract textual and visual embeddings from individual tweet messages (textual) and Google Street View images (visual), with the latter capturing the geographical and environmental context surrounding individuals' residential and workplace areas. Next, these high-dimensional multimodal features are fed into a multilayer transfer learning model for individual occupation classification. The proposed occupation prediction method achieves high evaluation scores for identifying Office workers, Students, and Others or Jobless people, with the F1 score for identifying Office workers surpassing the best previously reported scores for occupation classification using social media data.}

        abstract = {Urban morphology profoundly influences city planning and experiences significant transformations as cities evolve. This paper investigates paradigm shifts in block-level planning through a case study of Singapore, a city celebrated for its precision in urban planning and swift transformation. Integrating urban morphology theories with empirical data, we explore Singapore's block-level urban form across various stages of development. Utilising a Spacematrix approach alongside a clustering analysis of urban blocks, we categorise Singapore's towns into four distinct clusters: Suburban, Balanced Mix, Dense Urban, and Vertical Growth, each reflecting unique density patterns and building forms. This clustering reveals how Singapore's planning ideologies have transitioned from maximising space utilisation to prioritising sustainability and quality of living. This signifies a paradigm shift towards a comprehensive and inclusive urban design ethos. The paper contributes to the urban planning discourse by underscoring the technological advancements, especially with merging spatial data and GIS, in shaping modern urban analytics and planning. The insights from the clustering analysis enhance our understanding of Singapore's exceptional urban path and offer valuable perspectives for other metropolises navigating the complexities of urban expansion and sustainability.}

        abstract = {Machine learning (ML) and Artificial Intelligence (AI) models have been increasingly adopted for geospatial tasks. However, geospatial data (such as points and raster cells) are often influenced by underlying spatial effects, and current model designs often lack adequate consideration of these effects. Determining the efficient model structure for representing geospatial data and capturing the underlying complex spatial and contextual effects still needs to be explored. To address this gap, we propose a Transformer-like encoder-decoder architecture to first represent geospatial data with respect to their corresponding geospatial context, and then decode the representation for task-specific inferences. The encoder consists of embedding layers that transform the input location and attributes of geospatial data into meaningful embedding vectors. The decoder comprises task-specific neural network layers that map the encoder outputs to the final output. Spatial contextual effects are measured using explainable artificial intelligence (XAI) methods. We evaluate and compare the performance of our model with other model structures on both synthetic and real-world datasets for spatial regression and interpolation tasks. This work proposes a generalizable approach to better modeling and measuring complex spatial contextual effects, potentially contribute to efficient and reliable urban analytic applications that require geo-context information.}

        abstract = {Streets are a crucial part of the built environment, and their layouts, the street patterns, are widely researched and contribute to a quantitative understanding of urban morphology. However, traditional street pattern analysis only considers a few broadly defined characteristics. It uses administrative boundaries and grids as units of analysis that fail to encompass the diversity and complexity of street networks. To address these challenges, this research proposes a machine learning-based approach to automatically recognise street patterns that employs an adaptive analysis unit based on street-based local areas (SLAs). SLAs use a network partitioning technique that can adapt to distinct street networks, making it particularly suitable for different urban contexts. By calculating several streets' network metrics and performing a hierarchical clustering method, streets with similar characters are grouped under the same street pattern. A case study is carried out in six cities worldwide. The results show that street pattern types are rather diverse and hierarchical, and categorising them into clearly demarcated taxonomy is challenging. The study derives a set of new morphometrics-based street patterns with four major types that resemble conventional street patterns and eleven sub-types to significantly increase their diversity for broader coverage of urban morphology. The new patterns capture urban structural differences across cities, such as the urban-suburban division and the number of urban centres present. In conclusion, the proposed machine learning-based morphometric street pattern to characterise urban morphology has an enhanced ability to encompass more information from the built environment while maintaining the intuitiveness of using patterns.},

Focusing on six diverse cities, the research employed supervised machine learning to classify street networks into gridiron, organic, hybrid, and cul-de-sac patterns with the street-based local area (SLA) as the unit of analysis. Utilising quantitative street metrics and GIS, the study analysed the urban form through the random forest method, which reveals the predictive features of urban patterns and enables a deeper understanding of the spatial structures of cities. The findings showed distinctive spatial structures, such as ring formations and urban cores, indicating stages of urban development and socioeconomic narratives. It also showed that the unit of analysis has a major impact on the identification and study of street patterns. Concluding that machine learning is a critical tool in urban morphology, the research suggests that future studies should expand this framework to include more cities and urban elements. This would enhance the predictive modelling of urban growth and inform sustainable, human-centric urban planning. The implications of this study are significant for policymakers and urban planners seeking to harness data-driven insights for the development of cities.},

This study employs graph convolutional networks (GCNs) to analyze street network structures. A two-branch GCN was used as the backbone to extract comparable features among street networks. The proposed approach was used to examine the structures of different urban road networks in a case study of polycentricity prediction across 298 Chinese cities. The model transformed approximately 4.5-million street segments into natural streets to create urban street graphs, which were subsequently analyzed to extract local and global embeddings. The extracted embeddings - with a portion labeled with a known urban polycentricity score - were used to predict the score for each city through a single-layer perceptron (SLP) model. Our results show consistency between the predicted polycentricity scores based on the derived street embeddings and those based on the population. Thus, the proposed GCN-based method can effectively predict the complexity and interconnection of street networks in different cities. This innovative integration of GCNs into urban studies demonstrates that deep learning techniques can analyze and comprehend the intricate patterns of street networks on a large scale.},

Urban agriculture projects can increase access to fresh food, improve mental health and nutrition, and empower and bring communities together. We investigated the distribution of urban agriculture in Glasgow and found that the current configuration of urban agriculture projects is mostly located centrally in the city, covering 36 \% of the total population (approximately 635,000) within 10-minute walking distance. We also found a positive correlation (r = 0.13, p = 0.0003) between the walking travel time to the nearest urban agriculture project and the food desert status. To increase urban agriculture access across the city, we used the Maximal Covering Location Problem (MCLP) model to optimally situate new urban agriculture projects on vacant and derelict land to maximize the covered population. We identified that a minimum of 15 new urban agriculture projects could increase the population coverage to 49 \% and equalize the access disparity to a statistically non-significant level. This research shows that converting vacant and derelict land in Glasgow into urban agriculture projects could both help with the city's problem of vacant and derelict land and bring many potential benefits to local communities.}

It is a master plan that builds upon the EU AI High-Level Expert Group guidelines. This article reviews the masterplan, from a culture cycle perspective, to reflect on its potential clashes with current societal, technical, and methodological constraints. We identify two main obstacles in the implementation of this plan: (i) the lack of a coherent EU vision to drive future decision-making processes at state and local levels and (ii) the lack of methods to support a sustainable diffusion of AI in our society. The lack of a coherent vision stems from not considering societal differences across the EU member states. We suggest that these differences may lead to a fractured market and an AI crisis in which different members of the EU will adopt nation-centric strategies to exploit AI, thus preventing the development of a frictionless market as envisaged by the EU. Moreover, the Commission aims at changing the AI development culture proposing a human-centred and safety-first perspective that is not supported by methodological advancements, thus taking the risks of unforeseen social and societal impacts of AI. We discuss potential societal, technical, and methodological gaps that should be filled to avoid the risks of developing AI systems at the expense of society. Our analysis results in the recommendation that the EU regulators and policymakers consider how to complement the EC programme with rules and compensatory mechanisms to avoid market fragmentation due to local and global ambitions. Moreover, regulators should go beyond the human-centred approach establishing a research agenda seeking answers to the technical and methodological open questions regarding the development and assessment of human-AI co-action aiming for a sustainable AI diffusion in the society.},

So far, the quality of PUD products has been limited by the spatio-temporal resolution of these datasets. Using Sentinel-1 SAR missions with a 10 m pixel spacing and a weekly repeat cycle, this study, for the first time, explores the potential of using a time series of Sentinel-1 SAR images for measuring urban polycentricity. In particular, we develop a variance-based filtering method to mitigate speckle noise. We propose the Kittler and Illingworth with a Modified Model (KI-MM) method to accurately identify PUD-related changes. We focus on the mean distance of new-born patches and the mean patch area for a PUD-related change analysis. These allow us to associate SAR tailor-made output with PUDs. The proposed methods were implemented on Google Earth Engine platform using 304 Sentinel-1 SAR images on the city of Shanghai, China, acquired between 2015 and 2018. We have tested 80 distribution models and found that the Laplace distribution is the best model for the KI-MM method. Our results show 2526, 2409, 4232 new-born patches for 2015-2016, 2016-2017, 2017-2018, with areas equal to 18, 20, 36 km2, respectively.

However, the current knowledge about the spatial patterns that indicate the relationship between the anthropological or environmental features and the air pollutant concentrations in industrial regions is limited. Thus, in this study, we aimed to identify the factors that affect air-pollutant concentrations due to local spatial impacts in industrial regions across Australia. Considering the large spatial scale, the impact of a global factor can be overwhelmed by another factor due to local spatial impacts, and the phenomenon is a kind of spatial disparity. We developed a novel set of methods, including a point-of-interests-based spatial identification method and geographically weighted regression (with standardised coefficients), to: (i) identify the industrial regions in the study area, (ii) collect the remote sensing factors, and (iii) identify the factors that affect the spatial disparity of air-pollutant concentrations in industrial regions. The results indicated a significant spatial disparity in the air pollutant concentrations in the industrial region, at a continental scale. Anthropogenic factors significantly affected the spatial patterns of air pollutant concentrations in the industrial regions that were remote to cities, whereas meteorological and topographical factors had significant impacts on the air pollutant distributions in urban industrial regions. Furthermore, within the nationwide industrial lands, drives of the relatively high concentrations of ozone and sulphur dioxide, the drivers of the air pollutant concentrations were environmental factors; high concentrations of nitrogen dioxide were more associated with the topographical features of the region. The methods proposed in this study can serve as a reliable framework for analysing the air quality of industrial regions and can also, supplement future studies on emissions reduction in industrial parks.},

        abstract = {Mass gatherings provide conditions for the transmission of infectious diseases and pose complex challenges to public health. Faced with the COVID-19 pandemic, governments and health experts called for suspension of gatherings in order to reduce social contact via which virus is transmitted. However, few studies have investigated the contribution of mass gatherings to COVID-19 transmission in local communities. In Hong Kong, the coincidence of the relaxation of group gathering restrictions with demonstrations against the National Security Law in mid-2020 raised concerns about the safety of mass gatherings under the pandemic. Therefore, this study examines the impacts of mass gatherings on the local transmission of COVID-19 and evaluates the importance of social distancing policies. With an aggregated dataset of epidemiological, city-level meteorological and socioeconomic data, a Synthetic Control Method (SCM) is used for constructing a 'synthetic Hong Kong' from over 200 Chinese cities. This counterfactual control unit is used to simulate COVID-19 infection patterns (i.e., the number of total cases and daily new cases) in the absence of mass gatherings. Comparing the hypothetical trends and the actual ones, our results indicate that the infection rate observed in Hong Kong is substantially higher than that in the counterfactual control unit (2.63\% vs. 0.07\%). As estimated, mass gatherings increased the number of new infections by 62 cases (or 87.58\% of total new cases) over the 10-day period and by 737 cases (or 97.23\%) over the 30-day period. These findings suggest the necessity of tightening social distancing policies, especially the prohibition on group gathering regulation (POGGR), to prevent and control COVID-19 outbreaks.},

        abstract = {In the U.S., various anti-sprawl land use regulations have been implemented for over two decades. Previous studies primarily investigate the impacts of local land use regulations or neighborhood-level built environment attributes on travel behaviors within a narrow time frame. Through a different lens, this paper examines how various local land use regulations and transit investment, both measured at the aggregated metropolitan level, have affected people's long-term travel behaviors over a 15-year period, and how these impacts differ between younger and older age groups. This study combines a set of land use regulation indices measured at the metropolitan level in 2003 with 15 years of travel data (2005-2019) from a pooled representative sample of over 8 million workers in the 50 largest U.S. metropolitan areas. Results show several local anti-sprawl land use regulations (e.g., growth containment, adequate public facilities, and moratoria), when combined at the metropolitan level, effectively reduced driving notwithstanding their marginal effects. Government investment in public transit also significantly increased commuters' likelihood of using public transit and, carpooling, as well as increased carpool group size. Moreover, the commuting mode choices of younger workers are more responsive to transit improvements and land use regulations. Urban planners should commit to regional cooperative planning to promote effective land use regulations at the metropolitan level. Regional collaborative entities, such as metropolitan planning organizations should play a larger role in coordinating local land use planning and regulations. To reduce automobile dependency, planners should commit to improving public transit through enhanced financial assistance, harnessing land use regulations in a more targeted way, and accommodating the needs of different age cohorts.}

Contributing to such discussions, this paper considers the city of Atlanta as a case study and explores the links between the spatial disparity of accessibility to different Uber ridesharing products and features of the built environment extracted from Google Street View (GSV) imagery. The variability of wait time for an Uber service is used as a proxy of accessibility, while semantic image segmentation is performed on GSV imagery using a deep learning model DeepLabv3+ to identify notable spatial features captured at the eye-level perspective around service pick-up points. Results from spatial models show that proportions of built environment features such as buildings, vegetation, and terrains are associated with longer waiting times. In contrast, larger salient regions with foreground features are associated with shorter waiting times for several Uber service products.}

However, Western-centric urban theories and studies of spatial inequality have not paid sufficient attention to the connection between income divergence and urban expansion. This paper employed a panel quantile regression model to investigate this relationship in 220 prefecture-level Chinese cities in 2006-2014. To identify potential spatiotemporal effects, we conducted additional robustness checks using the spatial Durbin model and geographical and temporal weighted regression. The results show that a 1 \% expansion of urban land decreases the urban-rural income gap by 0.005 \% to 0.011 \%. This narrowing effect is particularly prominent in the eastern and central regions and in areas that are less urbanized overall. It also varies within regions that have a more pronounced difference between the lowest and highest quantiles in northeastern China and cities with urbanization rates of \&gt;50 \%. Finally, we find evidence for an inverted U-shaped relationship between urban expansion and the urban-rural income gap. Our results entail suggestions for improved urban-rural development policies aimed toward greater integration and efficiency in urban expansion.},

We further explored its capacity for identifying UFRs by integrating it with three widely used UFR identification methods. The results reveal that our proposed approach can correctly identify 10\% more UFRs compared with the traditional grid-based method, showing the efficiency of our proposed approach for identifying UFRs at a finer scale.

To this end, we specify a composite network consisting of air/train/road connectivity and analyze cities' eigenvector and betweenness centralities within these networks. We find that the importance of national spaces for inter-city connectivity is much more evident in the Horn of Africa than in other parts of the world, which is also visible in the peripheralization of cities in borderlands. We argue that the region's connectivity needs to be understood from a multiscalar and multimodal perspective and provide a baseline against which the impact of future interventions aimed at enhancing city connectivity/regional integration can be examined.},

This research applies spatial regression models combined with computer vision and deep learning to analyse traffic flow distributions via various factors in the urban areas and traffic flow data. We include road characteristics and surrounding environments such as land use/cover, nearby points of interest (POI) and Google Street View images. The results show that the daily average traffic flow on main roads is much higher than smaller roads, and nearby POIs numbers have positive effect on traffic flows. The impact of land cover type is insignificant in the linear regression model, while demonstrates significant contribution to traffic flows in spatial regression models. Although the spatial autocorrelation still exists after the spatial regression, the spatial error model generates a better fit on the dataset. Further analysis will focus on extend the current model with the time parameters and understand what influence the changes of traffic flow in the different spatio-temporal scales.},

Taxi demand is affected by various built-environment factors and by the time of the day. Although many studies have investigated correlations between taxi demand and the built environment, the direct and spillover effects of built environment factors on taxi demand have not been examined at a fine spatial scale. To address this gap in the literature, this paper employs spatial econometric models using GPS-tracked taxi trips, mobile signaling data, and points of interest (POIs) to study taxi demand in Beijing at a 1-kilometer square grid resolution. The results show that, in the morning and evening peak hours, road network density has the strongest (positive) direct and indirect impact on taxi ridership. A relationship is also found between public transportation and taxi ridership: bus coverage has positive direct effects and insignificant indirect effects on taxi pick-ups and drop-offs, while subway coverage has negative indirect effects, suggesting that it may absorb taxi demand from surrounding grids. Results also indicate that various built-environment factors affect taxi demand differently at morning and evening peak times. This study reveals the complex nature of taxi ridership and has important implications for policymakers, transport planners, and other stakeholders in megacities around the world.},

At present, heritage area vitality is often adopted as a general conservation method to increase the vibrancy of such areas. However, it remains unclear whether urban morphological elements suitable for urban areas can be applied to heritage areas. This study uses ridge regression and LightGBM with multi-source big geospatial data to explore whether urban morphological elements that affect the vitality of heritage and urban areas are consistent or have different spatial distributions and daily variations. From a sample of 12 Chinese cities, our analysis shows the following results. First, factors affecting urban vitality differ from those influencing heritage areas. Second, factors influencing urban and heritage areas' vitality have diurnal variations and differ across cities. The overarching contribution of this study is to propose a quantitative and replicable framework for heritage adaptation, combining urban morphology and vitality measures derived from big geospatial data. This study also extends the understanding of forms of heritage areas and provides theoretical support for heritage conservation, urban construction, and economic development.},

To extract data on built environment features from GSV images, we applied a deep learning model, DeepLabv3+. We then used elastic net regression to test the relationship between the built environment empirically - distinguishing between car-related, walking-related and mixed-use land infrastructure - and the survival of neighbourhood organisations. This testing approach is novel, to our knowledge not yet having been applied in Urban Studies. Besides revealing the effects of built environment features on the social life between buildings, our study points to the value of easily applicable observational big data.

Taking Ipswich City (Australia) and Enschede (the Netherlands) as two testbeds, we examine the spatial patterns of a total of 21 accessibility measures in the two cities and conduct a correlation and principal component analysis to unravel the interrelationship between these measures. The results suggest that among all measures under the three approaches, the selection of distance thresholds and transport modes matter more to accessibility measures than the destination choices. Furthermore, when distance threshold and transport mode are held constant, the network-based and entrance-based methods provide more realistic accessibility measures than other methods. We also discuss the generality of the entrance-based method we propose and suggest ways to choose the most appropriate accessibility measure for use in different contexts.},

One potential mitigation strategy is to improve our understanding of how the geographical patterns of urban land use influence congestion. Unfortunately, there is no consensus regarding if more sprawling or dense urban morphologies help mitigate congestion issues. To potentially clarify the conflicting findings of previous studies, we used a detailed spatial metric-based approach and panel regression to quantify the relationships between urban development patterns and congestion in 98 US urban areas from 2001 to 2011. We found that the abundance and spatial configuration of urban land uses were correlated with traffic congestion. Specifically, high degrees of polycentricity for both high-intensity and low-intensity urban land uses were associated with more congestion, while contiguous residential development was correlated with less congestion. Important distinctions were also observed between different congestion measures, as urban morphology exhibited a more substantial influence on overall congestion than rush-hour congestion. Our findings can potentially inform future land use planning by clarifying which urban morphologies alleviate traffic congestion issues.}

The results suggest that planning practices impact urban spatial structure and its spatial interaction by redistributing urban morphological elements, such as employment in this study. Also, our results show that the physical urban spatial structure and spatial interaction are closely related. These results reinforce the role of urban planning practice to achieve a more sustainable and coherent urban built environment.

Two brief empirical analyses of the degree of morphological polycentricity in Polish NUTS-3 areas and the Chinese city-regions along the 'Yangtze Economic Belt' are included.

Earlier studies have examined various factors that may contribute to the contagion rate of COVID-19, such as air pollution, smoking, humidity, and temperature. As there is a lack of studies at the neighborhood-level detailing the spatial settings of built environment attributes, this study explored the variations in the size of the COVID-19 confirmed case clusters across the urban district Huangzhou in the city of Huanggang. Clusters of infectious cases in the initial outbreak of COVID-19 were identified geographically through GIS methods. The hypothetic relationships between built environment attributes and clusters of COVID-19 cases have been investigated with the structural equation model. The results show the statistically significant direct and indirect influences of commercial vitality and transportation infrastructure on the number of confirmed cases in an infectious cluster. The clues ch inducing a high risk of contagions have been evidenced and provided for the decision-making practice responding to the initial stage of possible severe epidemics, indicating that the local public health authorities should implement sufficient measures and adopt effective interventions in the areas and places with a high probability of crowded residents.},

Meanwhile, polycentric urban development has been highlighted by academics and policymakers as a sustainable urban development regime, although its purported benefits need to be further investigated. Against this background, this paper empirically examines the relationship between polycentricity and the provision of urban amenities in 309 Chinese cities. After controlling for the size, population density, wage, and human capital, this paper finds that a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity is associated with a larger number of urban amenities. Additionally, when all the covariates above are held, a higher degree of intra-urban polycentricity is associated with a greater diversity of urban amenities. Robust checks show that these findings are consistent with different polycentricity indices and diversity measures. Finally, possible explanations of the relationship between intra-urban polycentricity and urban amenities are provided from both the producer and consumer perspectives.},

        abstract = {The considerable gap between urban and rural areas in China has been one of those social problems during the urbanization process. Since the early 2000s, an increasing number of theoretical and empirical studies have discussed the association between urbanization and urban-rural income gap (URIG) in China. However, a very limited consensus has been reached so far, which makes it challenging to support formulating well-informed policies. To identify factors contributing to different conclusions of the effects of urbanization on URIG in China, we conducted a systematic literature review of 29 empirical studies and stepwise meta-regression analysis from 94 direct effect-size estimates. Our findings reveal that while urbanization is associated with larger URIG when URIG is measured via urban-rural income/consumption, urbanization is associated with smaller URIG when URIG is measured with inequality index (e.g., Theil index and/or Gini coefficient). Additionally, financial development is correlated with larger URIG. By contrast, human capital level, agricultural support policy, and farmland scale contribute to narrowing URIG. Finally, we did not find a significant publication bias from the primary studies. This work suggests that it is worth to conduct more in-depth analysis to examine the heterogeneous effects of different indicators of URIG and their associations with other potential driving factors. Future work is suggested to investigate the effects of financial development level, human capital level, agricultural support policy, farmland scale, and urban land scale on the relationship between urbanization and URIG. In the urbanization process, policymakers need to pay attention to the practice of remedying income-based urban-rural inequality.},

Meanwhile, road network structure has been analyzed from a network science perspective that focuses on nodes and relational links and aims to predictive models. However, limited empirical studies have explored the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility through such perspective. This paper utilizes the spatial Durbin model to understand the relationship between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility, proxied by Uber accessibility, through classical network measures of degree, closeness, and betweenness centrality. Taking the city of Atlanta as a case study, we have found in addition to population density and road network density, larger values of degree centrality and smaller values of closeness centrality of the road network are associated with better accessibility of Uber services. However, the effects of betweenness centrality are not significant. Furthermore, we have revealed heterogeneous effects of degree centrality and closeness centrality on the accessibility of Uber services, as the magnitudes of their effects vary by different time windows (i.e., weekday vs. weekend, rush hour in the morning vs. evening). Network science provides us both conceptual and methodological measures to understand the association between road network structure and ride-sharing accessibility. In this study, we constructed road network structure measures with OpenStreetMap, which is reproducible, replicable, and scalable because of its global coverage and public availability. The study resonates with the notion of cities as the set of interactions across networks, as we have observed time-sensitive heterogeneous effects of road network structure on ride-sharing accessibility.},

Despite the blossoming academic literature on polycentricity, only limited attempts have been made to explore whether and how polycentric urban development at different spatial scales affects the urban economy. In this paper, we empirically analyse whether and how urban polycentricity at different spatial scales in China is associated with urban economic performance. To this end, we extend the Cobb-Douglas production function and include measures of both inter-urban and intra-urban polycentricity to explain differences in labour productivity. The analysis links intra-urban monocentricity and inter-urban polycentricity with higher levels of labour productivity. In addition, the analysis points to an agglomeration spillover effect, as well as a potential weak positive interaction effect between intra- and inter-urban polycentricity. The paper concludes with policy implications for China's spatial development.}

        abstract = {In many big cities, the bike-sharing system (BSS) and taxi play critical roles in transportation services. They both offer on-demand transportation options and allow flexible riding scheduling and routing. Previous literature has compared BSS and taxi to other transport modes, such as public transit and private automobile, but little is known about the spatiotemporal factors that influence travel choices between these two alternatives. Understanding travel patterns of BSS and taxi is critical in traffic demand analysis and sustainable transportation planning. Also, an in-depth examination of the patterns of travel behaviors, especially when one would choose BSS over a taxi, will provide valuable insights on human mobility and active living research. In this study, we investigated the spatiotemporal patterns of BSS and taxi trips in Chicago from 2014 to 2016. To model travel choices between BSS and taxi, we applied machine learning techniques to simulate the means of transport based on environmental and temporal factors. Results show seasonal trip variations of the BSS and a declining trend of taxi trips. BSS speed is relatively stable while taxi speed varies primarily because of time and locations. Based on the random forest model, which has demonstrated the best fit with high processing speed, travel distance and the number of parks and recreational facilities seem to be critical spatial predicting factors of the travel choice. Given any time and location, the model can recommend the travel choices between BSS and taxis for users. This study shows the significance of machine learning techniques in urban mobility research. Results of the study may potentially support people's transportation decision-making and facilitate sustainable transportation planning.},

The emergence and development of the Internet of Things (IoT) have attracted growing attention to the low-cost location scheme, which can respond to a dramatic increasing amount of public infrastructure in smart cities. Various Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID)-based locating systems and noise mitigation methods have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for built environments in large areas due to their high cost, computational complexity, and low noise detection capability. In this paper, we proposed a novel noise mitigation solution integrating the low-cost localization scheme with one mobile RFID reader. We designed a filter algorithm to remove the influence of abnormal data. Inspired the sampling concept, a more carefully parameters calibration was carried out for noise data sampling to improve the accuracy and reduce the computational complexity. To achieve robust noise detection results, we employed the powerful noise detection capability of the random sample consensus (RANSAC) algorithm. Our experiments demonstrate the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed method for the localization and noise mitigation in a large area. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.}

We find that a higher level of subjectivity and readability and a longer length of textual review lead to lower overall customer satisfaction, and a higher level of diversity and sentiment polarity of textual review leads to higher overall customer satisfaction. We also find that customers' review involvement positively influences their overall satisfaction.

        abstract = {Recent developments for acquiring and distributing remotely-sensed data have greatly increased data availability to the user community. The past two decades have witnessed an explosion in data acquisition by a variety of ground, airborne and orbital sensors. The popularization of Unmanned Aerial Systems (UAS) and the development of reduced cost orbital platforms should guarantee that even higher data volumes will be available to future analysts. The past decades also saw the opening of image data archives (e.g., Landsat, CBERS, Sentinel), making access to a rich database of moderate resolution satellite images a reality across the globe. This increased volume and variety of remotely-sensed data increases the demand for methods and procedures for data handling and information extraction. This chapter describes recent efforts to expand the analyst's data processing toolset and includes the theory and strategies used in manipulating remotely-sensed data by digital systems. The text focuses on presenting algorithms and techniques for image processing and analysis and emphasizes recent developments not covered by previous editions of the ASPRS Manual of Remote Sensing. Although the main topics covered by the chapter involve the direct processing of images, the text also covers concepts involved in processing remote sensing data that may not have been collected or stored as images, such as spectral curves acquired by spectroradiometers. Several sections of this chapter match this description, including Spectral Vegetation Indices and Spectral Mixture Analysis. Image processing includes not only the analysis of images, but also the necessary steps involved in preparing images for analysis, such as geometric correction, atmospheric correction and several techniques associated with image enhancement. Spectral indices resulting from the combination of multiple spectral bands are presented, with emphasis on the description of vegetated targets. A detailed treatment is given to the mixture problem resulting from the contribution of multiple materials within the instantaneous field of view (IFOV) of a given sensor. Because multiple applications can benefit from the increased explanation power provided by a large number of spectral bands, hyperspectral data processing is also presented and discussed. Further, the chapter addresses the benefits and challenges involved in combining datasets acquired by different systems (Data Fusion). Image classification addresses multiple strategies involved in assigning classes to images (e.g., Support Vector Machine, and Decision Trees); and includes advances in Object-Based Image Analysis (OBIA), particularly those related to image segmentation in preparation for classification. Given the increasing length of remotely-sensed data time series, particular attention is given to preparing sequences of images and data, including multiple techniques for smoothing, spike removal and the retrieval of metrics associated with temporal variations of targets. The chapter also brings multiple examples of use of products derived from processing remotely-sensed data as input to a variety of workflows, including modeling and analysis efforts. Finally, very current topics involving recent advances in image acquisition and availability, are presented for generating 3D surfaces from multiple images using Structure from Motion (SfM); processing of very large datasets (Big Data); and processing of images in the cloud are presented.},

We present a typology of Chinese city-regions based on both (1) their inter-city polycentricity and (2) the intra-city polycentricity of the individual cities that comprise these urban regions. Overall, we find only limited levels of association between inter-city and intra-city polycentricity. The Pearl River and Yangtze River Deltas have high levels of inter-city and intra-city polycentricity. Most city-regions in Central and Western China are characterized by a primate urban system and low levels of inter-city polycentricity. We hypothesize the major economic, political, and geographical processes underlying observed patterns.},

In this study, we propose a conceptual framework of factors influencing sleep quality in hotels based on personal and hotel characteristics. Personal characteristics include demographic, biopsychosocial, and tripographic factors; hotel characteristics consist of hotel location, facilities, and the sleeping environment. By analyzing TripAdvisor hotel review data in Los Angeles, we estimate a mixed-effects ordered logit model to understand the factors that influence sleep quality as well as the hotel sleeping environment as indicated by sentiment analysis. The results validate our proposed conceptual model. Hotel sleep quality is found to vary by age, gender, traveler type, and review experience. In addition, hotel star rating, nearby restaurant density, number of hotel floors, and the hotel sleeping environment also influence hotel sleep quality. Implications of this study are provided in closing.}

Various radio frequency identification (RFID)-based locating systems have been developed. However, most of them are impractical for infrastructure asset inspection and management on a large scale due to their high cost, inefficient deployment, and complex environments such as emergencies or high-rise buildings. In this paper, we proposed a novel locating system by combing the Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) with RFID, in which a target tag was located with one RFID reader and one GNSS receiver with sufficient accuracy for infrastructure asset management. To overcome the cost challenge, one mobile RFID reader-mounted GNSS receiver is used to simulate multiple location known reference tags. A vast number of reference tags are necessary for current RFID-based locating systems, which means higher cost. To achieve fine-grained location accuracy, we utilize a distance-based power law weight algorithm to estimate the exact coordinates. Our experiment demonstrates the effectiveness and advantages of the proposed scheme with sufficient accuracy, low cost and easy deployment on a large scale. The proposed scheme has potential applications for location-based services in smart cities.},

Accessibility is measured by both the expectation and variability of Uber wait time. With spatial autoregressive models, we find that after controlling for other socioeconomic factors, wealth and race do not have significant associations with Uber accessibility. Additionally, higher road network density, population density, and less commuting time to work correlate with greater Uber accessibility. More public transport stops are related to better accessibility of UberX but worse accessibility of UberBLACK. Finally, implications for policy-makers are provided.},

CO2 emissions data are aggregated from the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDASv2) data portal. The analysis identifies substantial economies of scale in CO2 with respect to total population. Further, despite a substantial wealth effect on CO2 emissions, cities with more centralized and compact urban forms are associated with lesser emissions, ceteris paribus. Whereas existing analyses of CO2 emissions in Chinese cities have often been limited to a handful of provincial capitals, the analysis covers a larger sample of cities.

While it is claimed that social and environmental benefits are associated with the implementation of BSSs, few empirical studies have investigated the actual congestion reduction effect of BSSs on cities. To fill such gap, this paper aims to examine whether the launch of BSSs can reduce citywide congestion. With a panel dataset of 96 urban areas in the US from 2005 to 2014, we employed a difference-in-differences model with two-way fixed-effects panel regression. The results suggested that the introduction of BSSs shows a significant mixed impact on congestion in general: Larger cities get better off but richer cities get worse off. Such results are consistent with both subsample regression with propensity score matching and different congestion measures. Post-hoc analysis reveals that BSSs have a significant positive effect on reducing rush-hour congestion. Finally, implications, limitations, and future work directions are offered.},

Therefore, this paper firstly compares the Emission Database for Global Atmospheric Research (EDGAR), the Fossil Fuel Data Assimilation System (FFDAS), and the China High Resolution Emission Gridded Data (CHRED) against energy census data from the National Bureau of Statistics of China (NBSC) at the province level. Results revealed that CHRED-today's finest resolution and most bottom-up approach of CO2 emission estimation in China-is the most consistent dataset with NBSC among the three (with both Pearson's R and Kendall's {\ensuremath{\tau}} of 0.86). Secondly, EDGAR and FFDAS are compared with CHRED at the prefectural level. Finally, empirical models were developed to reconcile EDGAR and FFDAS with CHRED at both province and prefectural levels to facilitate future longitudinal studies of CO2 emissions in China.}

This paper proposes a travel-planning tool by crowdsourcing multiple UGCs to provide customized information for tourists. We harvested hotel customer reviews from TripAdvisor, photo information from Flickr, and travel costs between destinations from Uber. First, we used geospatial data mining approaches to extract tourism attractions information from Flickr; identified multi-facet characteristics of hotels with natural language processing (NLP); and provided travel route recommendations with graph analysis. Second, we developed a web-based interface to let users communicate with the system interactively, which provides integrated recommendations including attractions, hotels, and visit route sequences. Two cities in the United States (i.e. Atlanta and Chicago) were used as cases to illustrate our approaches. The proposed travel planning tool is not only beneficial to support customized travel decision-making, but also supportive for hotel managers with strategic management implications.}

To inform current and future management strategies, it is critical to provide estimates of how mangroves will respond to climate change in this region. Therefore, this paper utilized spatial analysis with model-based climatic indicators (temperature and precipitation) and mangrove distribution maps to estimate a benchmark for the mangrove biomass of the SBS in six scenarios, namely the Last Inter-glacial Period, the current scenario (1950-2000) and all four projected Representative Concentration Pathways in 2070 due to climate change. Despite mangroves gaining more biomass with climate change (the increase in CO2 concentration), this paper highlighted the great proportion of below-ground biomass in mangrove forests. It also showed that the changes in spatial distribution of mangrove biomass became more variable in the context of climate change. As mangroves have been proposed as an essential component of climate change strategies, this study can serve as a baseline for future studies and resource management strategies.},

Our empirical results suggest that over 90\% of Chinese cities have four or fewer 'centers', and approximately 40\% only have one 'dominating' center. Regression models reveal that higher degrees of polycentricity are associated with cities in fragmented landscapes. Conditioning on topographic characteristics and total land area, Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is associated positively with high polycentricity in Eastern China. Furthermore, our analysis suggests that the development of multiple (sub)centers in a number of cities (e.g., Shanghai and Tianjin) is relatively consistent with their master plans.},

        abstract = {Universities are where innovations, face-to-face interactions and social capital are commonplace. Nevertheless, often regarded as 'the ivory tower', universities cannot be separated from the social and economic transformations outside of them. Traffic, information and financial flows between universities and other locations can be used to reveal connections between the ivory tower and other locales. Therefore, this paper uses the weekday public transit smartcard records from 6 to 9 April 2010 (158,262 transit trips in total, including bus-only, bus plus subway and subway-only trips) to identify and profile the most popular destinations of student riders from the '985 universities' (a short list of top universities designated by the Chinese Central Government in 1999) and associated transit trip flows in Beijing. It identifies destination hotspots for the 985 universities' students in Beijing, allocates traffic volume to major roads and delineates the transit trips of students from each campus. The results indicate that there exist only weak ties and little movement between the top universities and the most disadvantaged areas.},

We proposed the first biophysical environmental delineation of the SBS using globally available satellite remote sensing and model-assimilated data to categorize this area into unique and meaningful biophysical classes. Specifically, the SBS was partitioned into eight biophysical classes characterized by similar sea surface temperature, chlorophyll a concentration, currents, and salinity patterns. Areas within each class were expected to have similar habitat types and ecosystem functions. Our work supplemented prevailing global marine management schemes by focusing in on a regional scale with finer spatial resolution. It also provided a baseline for academic research, ecological assessments and will facilitate marine spatial planning and conservation activities in the area. In addition, the framework and methods of delineating biophysical environments we presented can be expanded throughout the whole Coral Triangle to support research and conservation activities in this important region.},

        abstract = {When we examine the National Land Cover Database 2006 (NLCD 2006) in a small scale, we find out that there are only 4.5 ha (50 pixels) of emergent herbaceous wetlands in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia. In order to testify that it is not simply due to mapping error or uncertainty, we propose a geographic knowledge discovery (GKD) process based on NLCD. The GKD process consists of data preparation, data preprocessing, feature extraction and knowledge consolidation. A case study 'What geomorphological characteristics accommodate emergent herbaceous wetlands in North Georgia' is presented to illustrate the process. Geomorphological characteristics refer to digital elevation model (DEM) and eight DEM-derived variables, which are proxies to geomorphological conditions. Geographic data are inherently spatial dependent and heterogeneous and such properties are considered in data preparation. In feature extraction, the goal of the study and the nature of the data are taken into consideration to select a suitable algorithm. In knowledge consolidation, three steps of validation - with statistics, cross-validation and field survey - are presented. The proposed methods can be extended to GKD from NLCD for other purposes. The GKD results testify that the small area of emergent herbaceous wetlands in Athens-Clarke County, Georgia, is not due to mapping error or uncertainty. The case study also proves that See5 algorithm performs very well to extract the learned knowledge. The procedure that we propose with NLCD can be applied to other environmental monitoring purpose.},

        abstract = {Due to the problem that current methods obtaining the weight values in intensive land use evaluation is influenced much by subjectivity of experts, cloud models to determine weight values were introduced in this study. Taking Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone as an example, cloud models was applied in intensive land use evaluation of development zone. Results showed that the comprehensive intensive land use value of Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone was 0.889, which achieved a sound balance between the supply and demand of land use. The state of land use reached a relatively high level of land use intensity as well as industrial land coverage. Based on land use efficiency, the output intensity of industrial land and high-tech land were both relatively high. In terms of management performance, there was no idle land, which suggested relatively perfect outcome of management. In the end, this paper summarized the advantages of using cloud models by presenting a more objective outcome and more easy-to-achieve algorithm. The application of Cloud Models is conducive to intensive land use evaluation in a more scientific way, so that it will benefit the policy-making processes of Guilin Advanced Technology Industry Development Zone.}
